# ToolLibrary 

This project was started as a means to better organize each repo along with a how-to guide for generalized execution and execution through a C2 agent. In my case, the agent of choice was Sliver Interactive Beacons and much of the exploits are specific to the OSEP or PEN300 course. 

As such, this repo is still in private and will not be published as some of the exploits are challenge or exercise specific.
